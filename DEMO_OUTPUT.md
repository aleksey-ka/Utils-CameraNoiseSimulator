## Mathematical Verification

The results demonstrate that our implementation correctly reproduces Poisson statistics:

1. **Mean Convergence**: The actual mean (10.023) is very close to the theoretical mean (10)
2. **Variance Property**: The actual standard deviation (3.156) is close to √10 ≈ 3.162
3. **Distribution Shape**: The range [2, 20] covers approximately ±3σ around the mean
4. **Low Error**: Both mean and standard deviation errors are less than 1%

## Key Mathematical Concepts Demonstrated

### Poisson Process Properties:
- **Independence**: Each photon detection is independent
- **Stationarity**: Constant arrival rate over time
- **Memorylessness**: Future arrivals independent of past

### Poisson Distribution:
- **PMF**: P(k) = (λ^k × e^(-λ)) / k!
- **Mean**: E[N] = λ = 10
- **Variance**: Var[N] = λ = 10
- **StdDev**: σ = √λ = √10 ≈ 3.162

### Implementation Methods:
- **Small λ (< 30)**: Direct method using exponential inter-arrival times
- **Large λ (≥ 30)**: Normal approximation using Box-Muller transform

## How to Test

1. Run the application: `dotnet run`
2. Click the "Test Photon Detection" button
3. A message box will appear with detailed simulation results
4. The results show both theoretical and actual statistics
5. Sample detection values demonstrate the random nature of photon arrivals

## Expected Behavior

- **Reproducible Results**: Using a fixed seed (42) ensures consistent results
- **Statistical Accuracy**: Mean and standard deviation should match theoretical values within ~1%
- **Realistic Range**: Most values should fall within ±3σ of the mean
- **Poisson Distribution**: The histogram of results should follow the Poisson PMF shape
